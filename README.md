hacking sys to track people Ips

*Tracking people is a framework to track people in the internet capturing the ip.*

*This tool finds IP address of an RESOURCE(img,pdf,mp3) by parsing the request headers. *

*For example*
http://example.com/imagen.jpg will be capture the ip of a user so we add some parameters, the name could be one, because imagen.jpg no exist is a MODREWRITE RULE, so we need to track a user whos like the cars we send a mail(mail in this case because is a unique private visite,not public) with the image http://example.com/car123.jpg , this image not is adjunt file! is an html image tag <img src="http://example.com/car123.jpg"/> so the user will never be warning about somebody is tracking, because even if you check the link its a real image.


*What is IP Address Tracking Program used for?*
  *You get abusive mails from somebody and want to know where it has come from!
  *Someone mails you claiming to be from one place and you suspect that he or she is from another place
  *You just want to track an email you received
  *You want to trace an IP address or do an IP address lookup out of curiosity
